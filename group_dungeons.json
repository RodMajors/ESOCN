After becoming frustrated with the number of Altmer dying during the war, she started working on a secret project to end the war swiftly.\nThe Mages Guild discovered her plans but not the exact nature of the ritual she planned to perform, so they sent three mages, Bakkhara, Dracien Montue, and Speaks-With-Lights, to look into the situation and stop her if they could. They arrived at Elden Hollow but were unable to make any progress because of the Thalmor. They ask for your help to kill the enemies within, and they will follow and disrupt the ritual. By the third altar you will find and have to defeat the Canonreeve, but she managed to progress the ritual enough to release the evil in the cave.\nShe has a chance to drop the Face of the Serpent antiquity lead for the Ring of the Wild Hunt.",

The entrance can be found near Stillrise Village, southwest of Stormhold. Its dungeon sets are Gossamer, Hand of Mephala, and Widowmaker.\nThe Cradle of Shadows is an old Imperial fort that has been converted into the lair of the mysterious Silken Ring, a band of assassins who have defected from the Morag Tong, the Shadowscales and the Dark Brotherhood. They worship the Daedric Prince, Mephala. At first, the Silken Ring didn't appear to be a threat to the other assassin organizations, but now its members have taken to targeting former associates and killing their former employers' most reliable informants. They are led by ex-Morag Tong operative Dranos Velador and a strange figure known as the Lady of Lace.\nA small contingent of Shadowscales, led by Tsatva-Lan and Geel-Ma, have recently entered the fortress with the intention of destroying the Silken Ring. Tsatva-Lan learned that the members of the Ring have tapped into a source of immeasurable power, leading him to bring many of his cohorts along with him in raiding Mephala's nest. Tsatva-Lan and his group haven't returned. His former student, Hides-the-Ashes, has come to investigate. She believes that Tsatva-Lan has been abducted by the Silken Ring. Her fears are justified when she arrives to find the fort's entryway filled with dead Shadowscales, and Tsatva-Lan is nowhere to be found.",

The ruins can be entered from a cave at Hei-Halai, west of Stormhold. The entrance to Cold-Blood Cavern lies beneath a trap door in the tunnel leading to Mazzatun's entrance. Pages from the Mazzatun Style and a lead for the Bog-Blue Jasper Fetish (required for the Harpooner's Wading Kilt) have a chance to drop from the last boss.\nSimilar to the Imperial City group dungeons, Mazzatun has an objective quest as well as a repeatable pledge from Urgarlag Chief-bane. Hist Ponds serve as traps in this dungeon. Monkeys and frogs can be found throughout the dungeon. Its dungeon sets are Amber Plasm, Aspect of Mazzatun, and Heem-Jas' Retribution.\nThe Ruins of Mazzatun make up an ancient Argonian city inhabited by the Xit-Xaht Tribe. The Xit-Xaht have an affinity for the stone and the roots, and have recently taken to raiding other villages and enslaving the inhabitants. Those they capture are put to work, being forced to construct the sprawling city of Mazzatun. The city's construction doesn't entirely make sense; there are hallways leading nowhere and staircases that climb up to dead end walls. Aptly nicknamed the \"Puzzle City\", the ruins of old Mazzatun are like a sprawling maze.",

He hopes that doing so will result in him becoming Dragonborn, making him the rightful heir to the throne of Cyrodiil. Friend and fellow Dragonguard Chevalier Renald seeks to convince Grundwulf to turn away from the Hollowfang Clan.\nHe initially fights alongside the Hollowfang Clanmother, Nisaazda. He uses the Thu'um in battle, having been trained by the Greybeards in his youth. At the end of the battle, Nisaazda will die but Grundwulf survives, living for one more battle.\nFollowing Nisaazda's death, Grundwulf is weakened in your first encounter, and he will descend towards the site of Sahrotnax's crash-landing. There, he will complete the ritual, draining the dragon and becoming empowered by its blood.",
